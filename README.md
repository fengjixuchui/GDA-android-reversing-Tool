# GDA(GJoy Dex Analysizer)

Here, a new Dalvik bytecode decompiler, GDAï¼ˆthis project started in 2013 and released its first version 1.0 in 2015 at www.gda.wiki:9090) , is proposed and implemented in C++ to provide more sophisticated, fast and convenient decompilation support. GDA is completely self-independent and very stable. It supports APK, DEX, ODEX, oat files, and run without installation and Java VM support. GDA only takes up 2M of your disk space, and you can use it in any newly installed windows system and virtual machine system without additional configuration. In addition, GDA has more excellent features as follows:

```
Interactive operation:
    1.Cross-references for strings, classes, methods and fields;
    2.Searching for strings, classes methods and fields;
    3.Comments for java code;
    4.Rename methods,fields and classes;
    5.Save the analysis results in gda db file.
    ...
  
Utilities for Assisted Analysis:
    1.Extracting DEX from ODEX;
    2.Extracting DEX from OAT;
    3.XML Decoder (Component filter);
    4.Algorithm tool(Support rolling encryption and almost all popular encryption algorithms);
    5.Device memory dump(Dump so, odex, dex, oat file);
    ...
    
New features:
    1.Brand new dalvik decompiler in c++ with friendly GUI;
    2.Support python script and Java script;
    3.Packers Recognition;
    4.Multi-DEX supporting;
    5.Making and loading signature of the method;
    6.Malicious Behavior Scanning by API chains;
    7.Taint analysis to preview the behavior of variables;
    8.Taint analysis to trace the path of variables;
    9.De-obfuscate;
    10.API view with x-ref;
    11.Association of permissions with modules;
    12.Extract all the urls in APK.
    ...
```
