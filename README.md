# Àá GDA(GJoy Dex Analysizer)

GDA, a new Dalvik bytecode decompiler, is implemented in C++ to provide more sophisticated, fast and convenient decompilation support. GDA is completely self-independent and stable. It supports APK, DEX, ODEX, oat files, and run without installation and Java VM support. And you can use it in any newly installed windows system and virtual machine system without additional configuration. GDA original file is 2m, and the size of the new version is increased to 5M after VMP protection.

GDA is not only a decompiler, but also a powerful and fast reverse analysis platform. It supports not only routine analysis operations, but also malicious behavior detection, URL extraction, packer identification, variable tracking analysis, deobfuscation, Python& Java scripts, device memory extraction, dex extraction etc.

In addition, GDA has more excellent features as follows:



```
ùï¨ Interactive operation:
    1.Cross-references for strings, classes, methods and fields;
    2.Searching for strings, classes methods and fields;
    3.Comments for java code;
    4.Rename methods,fields and classes;
    5.Save the analysis results in gda db file.
    ...
  
ùï≠ Utilities for Assisted Analysis:
    1.Extracting DEX from ODEX;
    2.Extracting DEX from OAT;
    3.XML Decoder (Component filter);
    4.Algorithm tool(Support rolling encryption and almost all popular encryption algorithms);
    5.Device memory dump(Dump so, odex, dex, oat file);
    ...
    
ùïÆ New features:
    1.Brand new dalvik decompiler in c++ with friendly GUI;
    2.Support python script and Java script;
    3.Packers Recognition;
    4.Multi-DEX supporting;
    5.Making and loading signature of the method;
    6.Malicious Behavior Scanning by API chains;
    7.Taint analysis to preview the behavior of variables;
    8.Taint analysis to trace the path of variables;
    9.De-obfuscate;
    10.API view with x-ref;
    11.Association of permissions with modules;
    12.Extract all the urls in APK.
    ...
```

# Àá Supported platforms

  Only for windows

# Àá Usage:

  Drag file into GDA, if you wanna analyze `.jar/.class` file, please convert the `.jar/class` to `DEX` by `dx tool` in android sdk path `android-sdk/build-tools/{sdkversion}/`
  ```
  dx --dex --output=<target.dex> <origin.jar>
  ```
